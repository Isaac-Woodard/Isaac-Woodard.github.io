            <h3>Fall Coursework</h3>
    
            <h4>Design of Experiments</h4>
            <p>There were three areas of focus:  design of experiments methodology, statistical analysis, and learning the JMP statistics software package. Beyond the homework assignments, two group projects provided opportunities to apply the course concepts. </p>
            <p>For the first project, students designed a 2<sup>3</sup> full-factorial experiment to determine the best recipe for brewing a cup of coffee. The responses were the coffee concentration, measured as a Brix score, and the MaxDiff rankings from two taste testers. Both responses were modeled against the factors of brew time, temperature and coffee ground amount using JMP. The taste response was the primary criterion for deciding on an optimal recipe, with the Brix score providing a quantitative measure of the recipe's properties.</p>
            <p>In the second project I joined a group investigating quantum teleportation by running quantum circuits on IBM's quantum computer servers. The project was spearheaded by my classmate Max Canella, who wrote the project proposal and wrote the Python code for running the circuits. For this experiment we had five factors: circuit layout, entanglement quality, entanglement variability, initial state and pre-optimization. All but the circuit layout had three levels. Our goal was to minimize computation time while maximizing teleportation rate. The complexity of the design space lead us to use JMP's custom design feature to reduce the number of required runs. After collecting data, we modeled the computation time and teleportation rate against the factors. Teleportation rate depended primarily on the circuit layout, while computation time was most affected by a factor outside of our control: the quantum server selected to run the circuit.</p>
    
            <h4>Electron Microscopy Fundamentals</h4>
            <p>This course provided the opportunity to work with a Thermo Fisher Apreo 2 SEM and an FEI Tecnai F-20. Fundamentals concepts for both types of electron microscopy were covered as well. In addition to the coursework, I also imaged several types of paper prepared with sputter coating using the SEM.</p>

            <h4>Optical Modeling</h4>
            <p>The focus of this course was learning how to use the optics modeling software Zemax OpticStudio. Between lectures and Zemax tutorials, we created several optical systems and evaluated them in two technical reports.</p>
            <p><a href="projects/zemax.html">Zemax Papers</a></p>
            <h4>Image Processing Independent Study</h4>
            <p>This was a self-guided research course focused on learning image processing and analysis using ImageJ, an open-source Java program. Readings and exercises for the course came from <i>Principles of Digital Image Processing Vol I - Fundamental Techniques</i> by Wilhelm Burger and Mark J. Burge. Students presented their work on each exercise in weekly meetings with the instructor and fellow classmates.</p>
            <p>Most of the exercises involved writing plugins for ImageJ to process or analyze an image, or both. The plugins demonstrate  use of important concepts for image processing and analysis  such as histograms, point operations, filters, greyscale images, and RGB images.</p>

            <h4>Theory</h4>
            <p>3 and 4-level lasers, Acousto-optics, Fiber optics, Gaussian beams, Interferometers, Nonlinear optics, Optoelectronics, Quantum mechanics, Ray optics, Wave optics </p>
    
            <h4>Labs</h4>
            <p>Labs began in PHYS 626 with 6 exercises which each took about half a week. Work and analysis was recorded in lab notebooks. In PHYS 627 there were 3 larger assignments which each took a week to complete. Formal reports for 2 of the 3 labs were required. Lab work culminated with a month-long Advanced Project as its own course. All labs were completed in groups of 2-3. </p>

            <h3>Raman Spectroscopy Research</h3>
            <p>I was introduced to Raman Spectroscopy by Dr. Dmitri Tenne while volunteering in his lab over the summer. I went on to take two research credits with him from Fall 2018 to Spring 2019. </p>
            <p>Over the course of the research I became acquainted with the equipment used in the lab and the underlying physics of Raman Spectroscopy. The equipment included high-powered lasers, two different spectrometers, and a low pressure helium cooling system. I also had the chance to mount samples and perform data collection with the spectrometer software. More details can be seen on the dedicated page.</p>
