I keep source code for projects on this repo:

# Contents & Structure
Main pages are kept in the root directory, except for the main projects page. Pages for other projects are kept in projects/ with more subfolders for groups of projects. Styling and scripts are kept in styles/ and scripts/, while images/ and documents/ contain image and PDF content.

# TODO
- Add favicon
- Use better selector for span.header.
- Update PDF fallback text.
- Display formula properly on DLA page.
- Make html titles unique for each page.
