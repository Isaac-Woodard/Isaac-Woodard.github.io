# Contents & Structure
Main pages are kept in the root directory, except for the main projects page. Pages for projects are kept in projects/ with subfolders for groups of projects. CSS styling and java scripts are kept in styles/ and scripts/, while images/ and documents/ contain image and PDF content. 

The directory resume/ is used for digital copies of resumes. Links to those pages are only provided in the resumes themselves. The purpose of the digital copies is to make it easier to link resume content to the portfolio for reviewers whom may be interested in more detail.
