<p>Hi! My name is Isaac and I'm currently working as an Applications Engineer at MKS Instruments in Beaverton, OR. 

I have a master's degree in Applied Physics from the University of Oregon. There I attended the Knight Campus Graduate Internship Program (KCGIP) in the Optical Materials & Devices track. During the second half of the program, I completed an internship at MKS.

My undergraduate program was at Boise State University, where I graduated with a BS in Applied Physics along with minors in Computer Science, Materials Science & Engineering, and Applied Math. I worked there while a student as a stockroom assistant and an adjunct faculty member. I continued working there after graduating until starting the KCGIP.

Through my past work I've developed the communication and organizational skills critical to collaboration in a fast-paced environment. I am eager to play a part in driving technology forward as the technical systems we rely upon continue to grow ever more complex.</p>
