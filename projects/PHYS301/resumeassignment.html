            Resume Assignment
        </h1>

        <section>
            <p>In this assignment I tasked my students with finding a job posting for the Boise area with an interest in engineering or physics majors. They were then expected to create a resume for the posting using a template on Overleaf.</p>

            <p>My goal with this assignment was to ensure each of my students had experience making a professional resume before completing their program. That was something I neglected somewhat during my program, and it made things more difficult for me after I graduated. I also wanted to give them a useful resource for creating a resume. I made my first resume using Microsoft Word, but I found the templates it offered weren't suited for technical fields and trying to format sections consistently was difficult.</p>
            <p>Overleaf has many resume templates available on their site, along with templates for a variety of other things. Though at first glance LaTeX is harder to use than Word, it makes the task of formatting less confusing. For a professional document like a resume, consistent formatting is essential.</p>
            <p>After receiving their assignments, I gave them feedback based on my own research and experience with making technical resumes.</p>
