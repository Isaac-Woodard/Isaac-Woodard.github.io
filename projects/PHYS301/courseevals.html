            Course Evaluations
        </h1>

        <section>
            <p>I was very pleased with my course evaluations. In nearly every category my scores were above the department mean! This was even in spite of my students' less favorable perception of the university compared to the rest of the department.</p>
            <p>The first section is a summary of the results. The questions are then broken into two general categories: perceptions of the course and perceptions of the instructor.  Scores are displayed both on bar graphs and in text form. There were eight students enrolled in the course, five of which completed course evaluations.</p>
