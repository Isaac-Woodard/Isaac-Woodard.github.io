            CircuitLab
        </h1>

        <section>
            <p>CircuitLab is an online platform which allows users to build and simulate circuits from schematic.  In the past it has been recommended to students as a resource but this semester it was used as the primary means of completing the lab exercises.</p>
            <p>Using CircuitLab required modifying the instructions for the labs. The biggest change was explaining how to use the simulation interface to take measurements. CircuitLab has a few different simulation options including DC Simulation, Time-Domain Simulation, and Frequency-Domain Simulation. These had to be used to replace the operations of a multimeter and oscilloscope. Apart from this, some components had to be modified according to CircuitLab's availability and a few exercises had to be partially completed with MatLab.</p>
            <p>Dr. Kim and I established a routine to complete the modifications. He first inserted new instructions explaining how to perform the exercise with CircuitLab. I would then work through the exercise on CircuitLab with the new instructions and get back to him with my feedback on what worked and what didn't.</p>
            <p>Below are some CircuitLab schematics I built while testing the lab exercises. CircuitLab normally displays circuits with gridlines, but those have been removed for clarity.</p>
