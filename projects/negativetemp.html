            <p>The capstone course for my undergraduate physics program at BSU required each student to deliver a 20-minute presentation to peers and faculty, as well as submit a research paper on the same topic. Wanting to learn more about something exciting, I chose the phenomenon of negative absolute temperature as my topic.</p>
            <p>My first exposure to the theory of negative absolute temperature was in my thermal Physics class from the previous semester. That was the same course where I was introduced to entropy and the formal definition of temperature. Something about the connections between those concepts struck a chord, and so I started making plans for my capstone presentation before the course had even begun!</p>
            <p>Both the slides deck for the presentation and the paper are shown below. The paper covers much the same information as the presentation, but with a more detailed analysis of the theory. The paper's abstract provides an explanation of what negative absolute temperature is.</p>
