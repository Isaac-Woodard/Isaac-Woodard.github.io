            Lecture Aids
        </h1>

        <section>
            <p>Shown below are two of the lecture aids: one for Physics 111 and the other for Physics 112. They start with a section breaking down the learning goals of the lab exercise, the key concepts, new vocab & notation, and the essential formulas for easy reference. After that is a section for the lab theory and then the procedure.  Listed at the end are diagrams which the instructor might find useful. Equations and diagrams are noted in italics where the instructor is most likely to want to reference them.</p>

            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>I designed the lecture aids as an alternative resource to new lab instructors who preferred an outline style for their lecture notes, as well as a way to clarify the learning outcomes of each lab exercise. It can be difficult as a student instructor to distinguish between what you need to learn and what the students need to learn! Lab manuals often don't directly address what the students are expected to get out of each lab exercise, so on their own they aren't much help addressing the problem. The opening section of the lecture aids is meant to help the instructor understand the distance between them and the students and what they need to focus on to bridge the gap.</p>
            
            <h3>Lab Summary</h3>
            <p>The Torque & Static Equilibrium lab for Physics 111 is about balancing masses on a meter stick balance. The Resonant Air Columns lab for Physics 112 tasks students with finding the resonance points for several tuning forks in an adjustable water column.</p>
