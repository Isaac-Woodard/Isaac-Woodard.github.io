            Lecture Notes & Slides
        </h1>

        <section>
            <p>Show below are the lecture notes and slides for a lab from Physics 111 and from Physics 112. The lecture notes went through multiple revisions over my semesters teaching, while the slides were made in response to the remote learning environment.</p>

            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>The lecture notes follow the same general structure as the lab manuals. They start with an Overview section to introduce the goal of the lab before going over the theory for the lab and then the procedure. There are queues for formulas and diagrams which are meant to be drawn on the blackboard in the lab room. </p>
            <p>The slides were made with PowerPoint for the first few weeks of lab, but I switched to the LaTeX Beamer class in preparation for teaching Physics 301 in the coming spring.</p>
    
            <h3>Lab Summary</h3>
            <p>The Archimedes' Principle lab for Physics 111 is about measuring an object's density using several different methods and comparing them. The Ohm's Law & Bulbs lab for Physics 112 is about measuring resistance for resistors in series and in parallel as well as performing basic circuit analysis with a lightbulb box.</p>
