                <p>Hi! My name is Isaac and I'm currently working as an Applications Engineer at MKS Instruments in Beaverton, OR.</p> 
                <p>I have a master's degree in Applied Physics from the University of Oregon. There I attended the Knight Campus Graduate Internship Program (KCGIP) in the Optical Materials & Devices track. During the second half of the program, I completed an internship at MKS.</p>
                <p>My undergraduate program was at Boise State University, where I graduated with a BS in Applied Physics along with minors in Computer Science, Materials Science & Engineering, and Applied Math. I worked there while a student as a stockroom assistant and an adjunct faculty member. I continued working there after graduating until starting the KCGIP.</p>
                <p>Through my past work I've developed the communication and organizational skills critical to collaboration in a fast-paced environment. I am eager to play a part in driving technology forward as the technical systems we rely upon continue to grow ever more complex.</p>

        <section>
            <p>The Clifton Strengths Assessment is designed to point out what people do best. Rankings are given for <a href="https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/253715/34-cliftonstrengths-themes.aspx">34 strengths</a> which are further grouped into <a href="https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/253736/cliftonstrengths-domains.aspx">4 domains</a>. Below I've listed my top 5 strengths from my 2024 assessment to provide some context for what I bring to a team.</p>
