                <p>Hi! My name is Isaac and I'm currently working as an Applications Engineer at MKS Instruments in Beaverton, OR.</p> 
                <p>I have a master's degree in Applied Physics from the University of Oregon. There I attended the Knight Campus Graduate Internship Program (KCGIP) in the Optical Materials & Devices track. During the second half of the program, I completed an internship at MKS.</p>
                <p>My undergraduate program was at Boise State University, where I graduated with a BS in Applied Physics along with minors in Computer Science, Materials Science & Engineering, and Applied Math. I worked there while a student as a stockroom assistant and an adjunct faculty member. I continued working there after graduating until starting the KCGIP.</p>
                <p>Through my past work I've developed the communication and organizational skills critical to collaboration in a fast-paced environment. I am eager to play a part in driving technology forward as the technical systems we rely upon continue to grow ever more complex.</p>

                <p>While it hasn't been long since I started playing the violin, there are few things I'm more excited to do on the weekend.</p>
                <p>So far I've stuck to self-teaching using books and online sources. Relying on myself to guide my learning has been challenging in some ways, but it has also given me the freedom to explore what works best for me.</p>
                <p>What I've enjoyed most is the high technical challenge. It's easy to get discouraged when picking up a new instrument, but it's the constant stream of challenges which keeps me committed. Every practice session feels like another adventure.</p>

            <div>
                <p>I grew up on a diet of home-cooking and it's always been hard to accept that a restaurant can do better than I can with my own kitchen! Sometimes I'm right...sometimes I'm not. Fortunately, every failure is a chance to learn something new.</p>
                <p>Shown here is my fourth attempt making Mongolian beef. After trying a couple different recipes, I found one by Joshua Weissman on YouTube. Even with some substitutions, it was finally a notch or two above what takeout had to offer.</p>
                <p>Sometimes it's difficult to justify spending 2 or more hours on a meal. Apart from the challenge of finding and mastering a good recipe, what makes it worth it to me is the opportunity to share something delicious with other people. Good food is something everyone can enjoy!</p>

                <p>Gaming has become the main way I destress. I usually play games off the beaten track because there tends to be a greater emphasis on creativity. Jumping into a new setting, even if it's virtual, gives me a chance to look at things from ground zero and think outside the box.</p>
                <p>Multiplayer is an aspect of gaming I find myself appreciating more and more over time. My preference is for games which focus on teamwork, as opposed to competition. It's easy to throw players into a battle royale, but creating an environment which rewards teamwork allows players to engage on a deeper level.</p>
                <p>The best multiplayer game I've played to date is Deep Rock Galactic, where players take on the role of dwarves mining the alien-infested caves of Hoxxes IV. The game encourages teamwork with freeform mission objectives, but gives each player only a limited selection of equipment to do the job. Players quickly learn that even though they can try to succeed on their own, working together is much more efficient!</p>
